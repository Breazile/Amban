Electronics for an Amban sniper rifle from the Mandalorian. This adds lighting and sound effects leveraging the blaster config from the Proffie sound board.

What I used for this setup:

1) [Proffie 1.5 sound board](https://fredrik.hubbe.net/lightsaber/v4/) (also will work with the [Proffie 2.2 board](https://fredrik.hubbe.net/lightsaber/v5/)) - available [here](https://www.korbanth.com/collections/saber-parts/products/proffie-soundboard-v2-2-with-sd-card)
2) [Side NeoPixel strip](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3729) for the forks - just one cut in half
3) Single [NeoPixel](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1260) for the center of the fork, or use [this](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1612) or even a [bare pixel](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1655)
3) [28mm 4W speaker](https://tcsdcc.com/1694) - common speaker used in saber installs
4) [18650 Battery](https://www.thecustomsabershop.com/TrustFire-Protected-37V-2400mAh-18650-Li-Ion-Battery-2-pack-P517.aspx)
5) [Battery holder](https://www.thecustomsabershop.com/18650-Single-Cell-Holder-P886.aspx) - you could also put it into the cartridge slot where the round would go
6) [Power jack](https://www.thecustomsabershop.com/Switchcraft-21mm-Power-Jack-P822.aspx)(recharge port) - or just use a power switch
7) 2 momentary switches. I used [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073TYWX86/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XT3FLVM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) in my setup.
